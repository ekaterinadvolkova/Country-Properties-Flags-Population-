# Document-Object-Mode-Practicing
*This is the exercise done to practice Document Object Mode (MOD) in JavaScript. The idea is t modify the lists content and style.*

<h4>HTML file  contains an ordered list of countries and an empty text paragraph to display some country related information.</h4>
<h2> A Javascript  file does the following: </h2>
:snowflake:Removes certain item from list <br>
:snowflake:Adds some new country to the list with array and loop<br>
:snowflake:Changes the backroud color of the html<br>
:snowflake:Changes the backround color of every other item in the list to grey<br>
:snowflake:Hides the info paragraph at start<br>
:snowflake:Finds out the populations of the countries from the list and saves the data to the application<br>
:snowflake:Displays the population of the selected country in the info paragraph<br>
:snowflake:Creates an image element for displaying the flag of selected country<br>
:snowflake:Displays the flag of country only when user is pointing to it (just like population text)<br>
:cop:User can select a country by pointing with mouse cursor (mousever event)  <br>
